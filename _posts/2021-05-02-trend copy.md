## How it all began

---

I always wondered. Why is technology so unfriendly? Initially, I never considered the challenges associated with technology since I grew up alongside its advancements. However, while living with my mother and grandmother, I've observed how technology can genuinely disrupt and overwhelm them.

It all began with email. My school needed to reach out to my mother through email, but she didn't have an email account and had no clue how to create one. Despite my attempts to verbally guide her through the account creation process, my mother struggled to grasp the exact instructions. Following this incident, she confided in me, expressing that she felt "disconnected from the world within this palm-sized black box." While smartphones offer boundless opportunities and serve as a helpful tool for many, to certain individuals, these digital technologies can simply act as barriers, hindering them from performing actions they were once capable of in the real world.

So, I assisted my mother in creating an email account on her smartphone. While doing so, I explained the process to her, emphasizing the importance of knowing how to use email in the modern world. After successfully setting up her email account, my mother uttered something that deeply resonated with me. She said,

"I'm concerned about the possibility of not being able to reach you when you go to university in another country. If, for some reason, KakaoTalk doesn't function properly, will not be able to contact you?"

Her concern genuinely alarmed me and made me realize that technology barriers can create a divide between my mother and the fast-paced digital world I inhabit. This issue wasn't exclusive to my mother alone; my grandmother was also encountering similar challenges. When my grandmother initially started using KakaoTalk, she struggled immensely. She couldn't figure out how to select specific recipients for her messages, and sharing photos seemed impossible. Witnessing my grandmother's struggles with these technologies deeply saddened me because she didn't opt to use them willingly; societal pressure pushed her to adopt these technologies, thereby excluding those who are unable to embrace them.

## Evidences

As I observed closely, the issue of digital illiteracy, or the inability to adapt to modern technology, wasn't limited to just my family. On one occasion, when I visited a convalescent hospital, I witnessed how elderly individuals within the facility were all struggling with technology. Many of them found it challenging to send messages to their children or grandchildren.

I witnessed these elderly individuals, including my grandmother and my mother. Their struggles opened my eyes, and I came to a profound realization that I must strive to create a more accessible world for them. They perceived smartphones as enigmatic black boxes, where their fingers struggled to find their rightful place. With a sincere desire to prevent my loved ones from being hindered by technology, I resolved to make an effort to introduce them to a digital realm where things are more user-friendly and convenient.

My name is Joel, and I am a student. However, for now, my focus will be on guiding my loved ones into the digital world, as they have shown me the beauty of our Earth.
