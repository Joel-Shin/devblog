I always wondered. Why is technology so unfriendly? I have originally never thought about the difficulty of technology as I grew up together with them. However, as living with my mother and my grandmother, I have noticed that technology can really disturb and pressure them.

It first started with email. My school needed to contact my mother with gmail, but she had no email account, and she had no idea how to make a email account. Although I verbally told my mother for the instruction for creating a email acccount, my mother wasn't able to catch the exact instruction. After this incident, my mother told me that she felt "isolated from the world in this one-hand sized black box". Yes, the internet world inside smart phones are unlimited and act as a wing to help people perform their tasks. But to some people, these digital technologies just act as a barrier that restricts them from doing actions that they were able to do in the real world.

So I helped my mother making a email account by using her smart phone. I explained her as I was making the email account because knowing how to use email is essential in the modern world. After I finished making her email account and my mother said something that really striked me. My mother told me,

"I am worried if I cannot contact you when you go to university in other countries. If kakaotalk doesn't work for some reason, will I not be able to contact you?"

Her concern really worried me and made me realized that technology barriers can separate my mother with the fast, digital world I am living in. This problem was not occuring for my mother. My grandmother was also experiencing similar problems. When my grandmother first started using kakaotalk, she really had a difficult time getting used to it. She wasn't able to select the people she want to send messages to. She wasn't able to send photos. Seeing my grandmother experiencing difficulties in these technologies really hurted me because she didn't choose to use those technologies; she was forced to use as the society urges people to use technology and exclude those who can not use them.

As I saw near, this problem of digital illiteracy, or the incapability to adapt to modern technology, was not only confined to my families. One time I visited a convalescent hospotal and saw how the elderly people in the hospital were all experiencing difficulty in using technology. Most of them were even having hard time sending a message to their childrens or grandchildrens.

I saw these elderly people, I saw my grandmother, I saw my mother. After seeing all, I finally realized that I need to make a world easier for them. They were all seeing smart phones as a one-hand sized black box where their fingers cannot find its place go. As I truly desire for my loved ones to not get blocked by technology, I decidied to make effort to invite my loved ones to this playground where things are better and convinient.

I am Joel. I am a student. But for now, I will try to show them the digital world to ones who showed me Earth.
