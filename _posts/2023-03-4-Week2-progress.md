## Introduction

---

This blog will discuss about my journey of developing a mobile puzzle game for older generation to play (Maybe for demantia patients to improve their cognitive functions).
There will be information about necessary processes I need to go through while developing a game, and my things I learned.

## Motives

Since there are many people of older generation and people of demantia, I decided that a game for these people to improve their thinking skills were necessary

## Week I

---

In week 1, I learned about making a blog. Blog will help me record my learnings and ideas.
This would help me to reflect back my journey, and review what I learned.
It would act as an ***note*** and a ***diary***

## Week II

---

### **Learning IA**

---

**What is IA?**

IA is the information architecture, and it is the organization of information in the most logical and effective manner so as to produce the most seamless human to digital product interaction possible.

I tried making an IA for a puzzle game. There were contents about login, home, gaming settings, and etc.

---

## Wireframe

---

**What is wireframe?**

Wireframe is a two-dimensional illustration of a page's interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors.

I tried constructing a wirefrmae for the results page for a puzzle game.

---

## Idea Phase

---

After learning general knowledge about IA and wireframe, I started trying to think of an idea for a game.
My game needed to be easy to program, and easy for the player to play.
It needed easy learnability!!!

---
So these were my ideas...

**Idea I**
My first idea was ***Word matching***. The objective of this game is to think of the complete version of the proverb, and type the answer faster than the competent.
To expand, the puzzle can be expanded, not only restricted to proberbs. There can be puzzles about quotes, foods, animals, and etc. The player can choose what they want to play.

**Expected benefits**
People playing this game can remind themselves of the imformation they already had knew, or learn new information. By doing this continuously, people can improve their memory.

**Hardships**
The programming steps can require extra effort because it needs different language, and many words would need to be input for the player not to encounter the same word.

**Idea II**
The second idea was **Block matching**. The objective of the game is to assemble the given fragments of shape to make the goal shape.

**Expected benefits**
By thinking the location of the pieces they would need to put in the fragments, players can develop their cognitive abilities and improve their sense of loaction. Improvement of sense of location is a valuable result since people lose this sense as they grow older.

**Hardships**
If not much function is added in the puzzle, than the puzzle difficulty could be way too easy. However, if functions are added, then the people could have hard time doing the puzzle. So, difficulty adjustment was a difficult process.

---

**So what idea got selected?**

Idea 2!

Idea 2 got selected because it was easier to code, and stimulated more thinking processes for players.

## Week III

---

## Rule Book

---

As every game has rules and objectives, it was essential to create a rule book that had all the instruction of the game.

First, I wrote about the general summary of the puzzle game. Then I wrote the basic rules.

After writing the general rules, I wrote about the case of reaching the objective of the game, and also the case of failing the objecetive of the game. Furthermore, I wrote about how to change the difficulty level: I suggested rotation and cutting abilities.
