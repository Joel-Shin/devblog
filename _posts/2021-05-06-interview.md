To make my plans happen in life, I first needed to know my limitations. I need to know that I don't have highly advanced computer science skills. I cannot make sophisticated robots or artificial intelligence. I must recognize that I am a simple student who only have enthusiasm and passion to solve this problem.

Before I actually go making realistic plans, I needed to clearly know the problems. Although I saw people experiencing types of technological difficulties, I actually needed more realistic, organized data that can help me identify and narrow the problem.

So, I decided to do an interview with my mother and my grandmother who I saw experiencing countless technology difficulties. When I interviewed them I asked for thr ee things: list of the technology problems they experienced, problems they experienced the most, and one technology they are used to.

So these were the results of the interview.

My mother and my grandmother had common problems with email, sending photos, using camera function, internet browing, setting up a password, using NETFLIX, and using a delivery service.

For differences, my grandmother generally had more problems than my mother did. My grandmother had problems installing apps or connecting to wifi.

The most frequent problems they experience was internet browsing. When I asked them when they experienced this problem, they both replied that they are not able to search up information they want to know. They blamed this for their long time use of books instead of internet browsers.

For one thing, problems that my grandmother often experience catched my attention. She frequently had difficult times in installing apps and connecting to wifi. These are severe problems that needs to be solved in order to properly engage with smart phone.

The technology they were used to were mostly things that they do one a daily basis, including reading news by smart phone and texting with kakaotalk. This told me that it is not entirely impossible to invite to the digital world.

After examining this data, I knew more about the relevant problems. The most severe problem was internet browsing, and installation of apps and wifi connection seemed to be problems that need to be solved too.

Seeing how they are used to technology which they use on a daily basis, I got a clue that repititiveness may be the key point of teaching them the modern technology.

By this interview, now I am a step closer in inviting my loved ones to this digital world. I narrowed down the most common problems; their problems almost entirely involved smart phones. I also learned that repititiveness can help them learn the modern technology. Now that I know the general problem and have a clue to solve it, now I need to go more deeply, making my imaginations into reality.
