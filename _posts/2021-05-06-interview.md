## Planning

---

To bring my plans to life, I first needed to acknowledge my limitations. I was aware that I didn't possess highly advanced computer science skills, and I couldn't create sophisticated robots or artificial intelligence. I had to accept that I was a simple student with nothing but enthusiasm and passion to tackle this problem.

Before I could formulate realistic plans, I had to gain a clear understanding of the issues at hand. Although I had witnessed people facing various technological difficulties, I needed more concrete and organized data to identify and narrow down the problem.

Consequently, I decided to conduct interviews with my mother and grandmother, who had experienced countless technology-related challenges. During the interviews, I asked them for three things: a list of the technology problems they encountered, the problems they encountered most frequently, and one technology they were familiar with.

## Results

Here are the results of the interviews:

## Analysis

---

Both my mother and grandmother faced common issues with email, sending photos, using the camera function, internet browsing, setting up passwords, accessing Netflix, and using delivery services.

However, my grandmother generally encountered more problems compared to my mother. She struggled with app installations and wifi connectivity.

The most frequent problem they both experienced was internet browsing. When I inquired about their specific struggles, they mentioned their difficulty in searching for desired information. They attributed this to their reliance on books rather than internet browsers.

One particular problem that caught my attention was my grandmother's frequent struggles with app installations and wifi connectivity. These were significant issues that needed to be addressed in order to effectively engage with smartphones.

As for technologies they were familiar with, they mostly involved daily activities such as reading news on smartphones and communicating through KakaoTalk. This indicated that it was not entirely impossible to introduce them to the digital world.

After analyzing this data, I gained a deeper understanding of the relevant problems. Internet browsing emerged as the most severe issue, while app installations and wifi connectivity were also significant challenges.

## Discussion

---

Observing their familiarity with technologies they used daily, I recognized that repetition might be the key to teaching them modern technology.

Through this interview process, I moved a step closer to inviting my loved ones into the digital world. I narrowed down the most common problems, which predominantly revolved around smartphones. Additionally, I discovered that repetition could aid their learning process. Now that I had a better grasp of the general problem and a potential solution, it was time to delve deeper and turn my imagination into reality.
