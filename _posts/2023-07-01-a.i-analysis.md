# Why AI Will Save the World by Marc Andreessen

---

## Summary:

The author incepts by defining what a.i is: “AI is a computer program like any other – it runs, takes input, processes, and generates output. AI’s output is useful across a wide range of fields, ranging from coding to medicine to law to the creative arts.” 

The author points out a misconception of people thinking that a.i might be human killer robots and argues that this is untrue. The author speaks of how the world would have been without the application of human intelligence and adds that a.i can improve the lives of people. He lists the advantage of a.i by providing examples of how future a.i can aid humans. 

Next, he discusses the fear of a.i by people. The author states that this moral panic was already out there even throughout history when new technology was introduced. The author categorizes the modern people who argue for the restriction and regulation of the a.i into two groups: The Baptists and the Bootleggers. He defines Baptists as people who sincerely believe that regulations and restrictions on a.i are needed. On the other hand, he defines Bootleggers as people who simply assert the need for restrictions on a.i for their financial profit.

Then he addresses five questions regarding the danger of a.i. 

### Will a.i kill us all?
He believes that the fear of a.i killing people is just from movies such as Terminator and that in real life, a.i murder is improbable.

### Will AI Ruin Our Society?
People believe that a.i can ruin society through hate speech and misinformation. The author states overall that even though there are chances, a.i is unlikely to ruin society.

### Will AI Take All Our Jobs?
People believe that a.i can replace human labor. The author disputes this idea and states that a.i will rather increase jobs and productivity, causing a lower unemployment rate.

### Will AI Lead To Crippling Inequality?
The author says that people think a.i will lead to inequality by making the a.i developers wealthier and making regular people poorer. The author disagrees with this idea and discusses how inequality may be worldwide, but technology doesn’t drive inequality. 

### Will AI Lead To Bad People Doing Bad Things?
The author states that although people are doing bad things with a.i is possible, it can be prevented by the government and smart people trying to stop these crimes with a.i.

The author also expresses his concern about China developing a.i faster than America and the West. The author also adds that we should pursue a.i not be replaced by the much darker Chinese vision. The author finally suggests a solution for the a.i. Some suggestions include letting a.i company aggressively develop their a.i not to be outcompeted by China. The author ends by attributing the heroes saying that “My firm and I are thrilled to back as many of them as we can, and we will stand alongside them and their work 100%.”

## My own thoughts: 

The author’s argument was insightful, and his behavior showed his care for America. His ideology showed his love toward a.i. However, I believe that the extreme development of a.i isn’t a good thing. I believe that some of his claims are way too naive and filled with optimism. For one point, I believe the unemployment rate wouldn’t decrease; instead, it would decrease as it is predicted to be by the public. The author stated that increased productivity by a.i will cause different jobs and higher wages for everyone, but the world doesn’t simply go that way. There is no society where everyone could benefit, like a utopia. If someone benefits, the other will lose. In this case, the wealthy will become wealthier, and the poor will get poorer. Therefore, although I agree that a.i development is inevitable, I believe the author’s optimistic view of the world wouldn’t go as he expects. We should first prepare to prevent possible crimes and hacking instead of just rushing through. We still have time, don’t we? If not, it would be the ones who need financial profit now from a.i.
