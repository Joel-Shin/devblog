## Written methods

After verbally educating my mother and my grandmother on email sending and receiving, I knew that the verbal method wasn't that bad. It was engaging and helpful. However, it was hard for people who had hearing disabilities, as it was shown by my grandmother's case, and it wasn't convinient because I needed to contact them every time. So, I tried to use a written method this time. I would give them a manual on how to use a technology, which is sending photos by kakaotalk this case.

## Process

I first informed my mohter and grandmother that I would hand them manuals on how to send photos by kakaotalk. The manuals I made had big font for my mother and grandmother to see and visual aids to guide their way of sending photos. So this was the manual I made:

This was the six step manual made. The steps were simple and was aided every step by an example photo.

In order to fully help my mother and my grandmother understand this manual, I made the manual as detailed as possible. I even included steps such as going in the kakaotalk app and told them what to press each time. This was because it could be confusing for them without a few steps that we think it is obvious for us. I needed to understand and acknowledge that what may seem obvious to us may not be obvious to others.

## Result

My mother and grandmother both told me that they were able to complete the task and understand how to send kakaotalk photos. They said they liked how each steps were clearly explained and especially how the photos show which place to click as they said they often have difficult time finding the buttons they need to click.

However, my mother and grandmother both told me that the manual method was disengaging, and that they didn't want it to learn technology from manuals. It was very boring to them as they feel like they don't need to know how to use this technology in a daily basis.

When I asked them whether the verbal or the manual method was better, they both replied that verbal method with actual interaction was signficantly better as it involoved actual interaction and made them feel more engaged and interested. Even my grandmother who had difficult time during the verbal method spoke that manuals was too disengaging and that she would probably not be able to do a more difficult task than sending photos my kakaotalk. She said that although she felt difficulty to hear, verbal method was more easier to learn even though it took more effort to hear.

In conclusion, I knew that the detailed steps of the manual is important, but it is not as important as the importance of engagement when it comes to teaching technology. After all, they all feel that they don't really need to learn these technologies. Nevertheless, technology use is crucial in today's setting, and I found out that interaction can bring engagement in those who learn the technology. Now I know that nobody wants to learn from a piece of paper, detailed or not. They need interaction, and I knew that they needed a method of interaction that can be more engaging, convinient, and detailed.
