## Written methods

After explaining the process of sending and receiving emails to my mother and grandmother verbally, I realized that the verbal method wasn't too bad. It was helpful and engaging. However, I encountered a challenge with people who had hearing disabilities, like my grandmother, as it was difficult for them. Additionally, it was inconvenient for me to contact them each time. So, I decided to try a written approach. This time, I prepared a manual on how to send photos using KakaoTalk.

## Process

To begin, I informed my mother and grandmother that I would provide them with manuals on sending photos via KakaoTalk. These manuals were designed with large font sizes for easy visibility and included visual aids to assist them in the process. Here's the manual I created:

The manual consisted of six simple steps, with each step accompanied by an example photo for guidance.

To ensure my mother and grandmother fully understood the manual, I made it as detailed as possible. I included instructions on how to navigate within the KakaoTalk app and specified which buttons to press at each stage. I understood the importance of not assuming certain steps were obvious to them, despite being obvious to us. It was crucial to acknowledge that what may seem clear to us might not be so for others.

## Result

As a result, both my mother and grandmother informed me that they were able to complete the task and understand how to send photos using KakaoTalk. They appreciated the clear explanations provided in each step, especially the visual cues indicating which buttons to click, as they often struggled to locate the necessary buttons.

However, they expressed that the manual method felt disengaging, and they didn't enjoy learning technology solely from manuals. It bored them, considering they didn't need to use this technology on a daily basis.

When I asked them to compare the verbal and manual methods, they both agreed that the verbal method with actual interaction was significantly better. The verbal method involved real-time interaction, making them feel more engaged and interested. Even my grandmother, who initially struggled with the verbal method due to her hearing difficulties, expressed that manuals were even more disengaging. She admitted that she would probably find it challenging to learn more complex tasks through manuals. Although hearing was an obstacle, the verbal method was still easier to grasp, despite requiring more effort to listen.

In conclusion, I realized that while detailed instructions in a manual are important, they are not as crucial as engagement when it comes to teaching technology. Ultimately, my mother and grandmother felt that they didn't necessarily need to learn these technologies. Nevertheless, in today's world, technology usage is vital. I discovered that interaction can enhance engagement for those learning technology. I now understand that nobody wants to learn solely from a piece of paper, regardless of its level of detail. They crave interaction, and I recognized the need for a more engaging, convenient, and detailed method of interaction.
