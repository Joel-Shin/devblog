## Real Video method


I taught my mother and grandmother how to use some technologies until now. However, all the methods I used to teach them was only theoretical and based on pictures. However, I thought that it would be much more effective to actually show them how it works. Then, it would have the similar effect of teaching them verbally as I first attempted, but it would also have the effect of being easier and convenient to learn. This time, I tried to teach them how to use kiosk, as kiosk is almost used in all restaurants these days.


## Process


To teach them how to utilize kiosk, I decided to take a video of doing kiosk myself. I went to burgerking, and took a video of me ordering a food using kiosk. I showed the entire step of using kiosk, such as choosing food, removing food, choosing how to pay, and etc. This is my video. Then, I edited the video so that it could have subtitles and be more visually appealing, as my grandmother have tough time hearing things.

To provide a brief overview, I first talked about how there are different categories in kiosk, such as main burger, side dish, and etc. Then, I talked about how I can order the food in each category and select the amount I want to order. I also mentioned that customers can remove what they had chose by mistake. Lastly, I showed them how I can order it and choose the method of paying.

## Result


Overall, both my mother and grandmother agreed that this was the most effective learning method so far.


It had all the advantages that was illustrated in my previous methods. It was as engaging as the verbal method, and it was as effective as the video method.


Especially, my grandmother loved this method as was much more easier to learn to her. Because I inserted subtitles, she could understand the video better. Also, since I actually demonstrated the whole process, my grandmother had stated that she now has the confidence to actually order a food in kiosk now.


Also for my mother, my mother claimed that this method was very easy to approach as it was just a youtube video, and the subtitles and edits made the video more engaging and easy to learn.


Now I have done this, now it may be the time to go a step further. As I seen until now, it is not a problem merely confined to my mother and grandmother. It can happen to everyone. Now that I found an effective way, I need to now find a method to expand this to people.
